### Code from "High-Throughput Characterization of Protein-Protein Interactions by Reprogramming Yeast Mating"

This repository contains all of the sequence analysis code that was used for the manuscript, along with example outputs for each step. Contents are divided into "pre-characterized PPI analysis" and "SSM library PPI analysis." The former is for the analysis of PPI networks in which all yeast strains were constructed and characterized individually. Therefore, the initial population percent of each strain in a batched mating is known and the unique barcode representing each synthetic adhesion protein (SAP) is also known.The latter is for the analysis of PPI networks in which one mating type is constructed with a library transformation, so the relative population size of each variant and the barcode(s) representing each variant is initially unknown.

This code will have to modified for general use, which will be an ongoing project for me as requests come in.
